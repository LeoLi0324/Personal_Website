    "text": "Generalization Error Research Project (In-Progress)\nI am fortunate to be advised by Professor Rishi Sonthalia. I want to express my gratitude for his willingness to involve me in this project and his invaluable mentorship.\nBackground: In the realm of machine learning, noise poses a ubiquitous challenge across images, audio, video, and data in general, stemming from various sources including sensor limitations, transmission errors, and environmental factors. Denoising techniques have thus become important to mitigate such distortions and enhance data quality while preserving essential details. Traditionally relying on signal processing methods, the advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has revolutionized denoising, empowering models to discern intricate patterns within noisy data. Recent advancements in deep learning, coupled with the availability of large-scale datasets, have propelled denoising algorithms to unprecedented levels of efficacy. Beyond improving visual and auditory media, denoising plays a pivotal role in domains such as medical imaging, surveillance, and digital forensics, bolstering data accuracy and reliability. As research continues to innovate, the pursuit of novel denoising methodologies promises to expand the horizons of data enhancement, fostering applications across diverse industries and domains.\n\nThis project focuses on a particular aspect of denoising, which can be theoretically analyzed: a data generative model characterized by the presence of both feature noise and label noise within the training data. Our primary objective is to reconstruct the underlying data generation process by identifying the optimal mapping from noisy observations to noisy output and examining the generation error on test data to capture meaningful behaviors.\nTechniques used: PyTorch simulations, random matrix theory, optimization algorithms, linear algebra, probability theory\nWe expect this project to be done by June 2024."
