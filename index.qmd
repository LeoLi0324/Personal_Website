## About Me

Hey there! My name is Jiping (Leo) Li, and I am a third-year student at University of California, Los Angeles ([UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/)). I double major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science, with a minor in Data Science Engineering. I am open to research or internship opportunities that involve machine learning and data science. Attached here is my [CV](/docs/CV.pdf "CV"). 

Mathematics has always fascinated me with its elegance and precision, while statistics adds that real-world applicability that keeps me grounded. My academic passion lies in the intersection of mathematics, algorithms, and machine learning. Exploring the intricacies of algorithms and unraveling patterns in data through ML techniques fuels my curiosity and keeps me engaged in this dynamic field.

When I'm not buried in code or textbooks, you'll likely find me lost in the world of cinema, where movies become my escape. I also have a fondness for the written word. Whether it's jotting down my thoughts, crafting stories, or exploring new ideas, writing serves as both a creative outlet and a means of expression for me.

Let's connect!
